RadiativeTransfer.jl aims to revamp and modernize key atmospheric remote sensing tools. Specifically, it will enable the fast computation of atmospheric optical properties, full-polarized radiative transfer simulations, and commonly-used inversion routines. 


By taking advantage of modern software tools, such as GPU acceleration and HPC computing, the software suite significantly accelerates computationally-intensive calculations and models, while keeping the interface easy-to-use for researchers and students.
